# ECS201C: Parallel Architectures. Spring 2019

The goal of this course is to become a better programmer by understanding the underlying system architecture and to get a better understanding of the underlying system architecture by programming the system.
This will be a programming-heavy course with about one programming assignment per week (fewer later in the quarter).
This is a graduate-level course, so it will be research focused with at least one paper reading per class and culminating in a research project with both a written report and presentations.

## Important information

### Teaching Assistant

**Ayaz Akram (yazakram@ucdavis.edu)**

### Accommodations

The exam schedule is available on the [schedule](schedule.csv).
Per [official UC Davis policy](http://catalog.ucdavis.edu/academicinfo/exams.html), if you have an accommodation request from the [Student Disability Center](https://sdc.ucdavis.edu/), or have any conflicts with exam times for religious observances, you must notify me **by the fourth class, January 14, 2018**.

For each test, quiz, etc. you must reach out to me *one week in advance* to schedule specific accommodations for that test, quiz, etc.

## Academic Misconduct

Academic misconduct is a serious issue.
You can find the official UC Davis policy on the [Office of Student Support and Judicial Affairs](http://sja.ucdavis.edu/) website.

You are expected to *cite all of the work you reference*.
Any ideas that are not specifically yours or generally known (e.g., caches hold data) should have a citation.
When in doubt, cite.

Any violations of this policy will result in reporting the violating student(s) to the Office of Student Support and Judicial Affairs.
This can result in a 0 on the assignment or an F in the class.

## Student Support

As a student you may experience a range of issues that can cause barriers to learning, such as strained relationships, increased anxiety, alcohol/drug problems, feeling down, difficulty concentrating and/or lack of motivation.
These mental health concerns or stressful events may lead to diminished academic performance or reduce a studentâ€™s ability to participate in daily activities.
UC Davis is committed to advancing the mental health and well-being of its students.
If you or someone you know is feeling overwhelmed, depressed, and/or in need of support, services are available.
You can learn more about the broad range of confidential mental health services available on campus via [Student Health and Counseling Services](https://shcs.ucdavis.edu/).

You can also contact me during office hours, via email, or by making a separate office hour appointment: [jlowepower@ucdavis.edu](mailto:jlowepower@ucdavis.edu).

## Assignments

### Grading Breakdown

| Category                | Percentage |
|-------------------------|------------|
| Participation           | 10%        |
| Programming assignments | 35%        |
| Project presentation    | 15%        |
| Project report          | 25%        |
| Paper reviews           | 15%        |

### Programming assignments

There will be a set of programming assignments that you will complete throughout the quarter.
Each assignment will ask you to write a parallel algorithm for a different architecture or using a different programming model (or both!).
You will have about one week to complete each assignment.

Programming assignments will be graded based on a write up, not on whether your code is right or wrong.
Each assignment will have 5-10 questions that you will answer about the code and/or its performance.

Links to the assignments will be available as they are prepared.

### Paper reviews

Each class you will be assigned a paper to review (it may be two papers in rare cases).
Your review should have the following rough outline:

- a short summary of the problem the paper attacks and methods used (if any),
- a short summary of the paper's results or key implications,
- your opinion about what's good and bad about the paper, and
- a topic/question for lecture

Reviews will be graded with the following rubric:

|   |                                                                                 |
|---|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 2 | Appropriate summary which clearly demonstrates an in-depth reading of the paper |
| 1 | Simple summary of the paper                                                     |
| 0 | Did not turn in the review                                                      |

In rare cases for an exemplary review you can be awarded 3 points.
These "extra credit" points are meant to offset cases of 1's and 0's.

I suggest you create reading groups to discuss the paper between yourselves before writing your reviews.
However, *your review should be completed individually*.

Reviews are due at 7am via Canvas.
