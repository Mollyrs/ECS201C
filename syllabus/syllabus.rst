Diversity and Inclusion Statement
---------------------------------
In an ideal world, science would be objective.
However, much of science is subjective and is historically built on a small subset of privileged voices.
In this class, we will make an effort to read papers from a diverse group of scientists, but limits still exist on this diversity.
I acknowledge that it is possible that there may be both overt and covert biases in the material due to the lens with which it was written, even though the material is primarily of a scientific nature.
Integrating a diverse set of experiences is important for a more comprehensive understanding of science.
I would like to discuss issues of diversity in computer science as part of the course from time to time.

Please contact me (in person or electronically) or submit anonymous feedback if you have any suggestions to improve the quality of the course materials.

Furthermore, I would like to create a learning environment for my students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.).
To help accomplish this:
* If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official records, please let me know!
* If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please donâ€™t hesitate to come and talk with me.
I want to be a resource for you.
Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback (which will lead to me making a general announcement to the class, if necessary to address your concerns).
If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the ... is an excellent resource.
* I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities.
If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.
(Again, anonymous feedback is always an option.)

As a participant in course discussions, you should also strive to honor the diversity of your classmates.
